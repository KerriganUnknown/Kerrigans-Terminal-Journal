Greetings User.

Claymore OS has been updated.
Version 1.1.0
	- added "Loading Screen" sound.
	- added UI button sounds.
	- added keystroke auditory feedback.
	- added character limit label in Entry window.
	- fixed the first line in Entry window text
		> first line can now be indented and saved
		> first line doesn't have to be used
			i. ie., user text can start on the second line

Be well.
